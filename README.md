# Financial Block
A new Flutter project to deliver cutting edge solutions for financial transactions

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Problem Statement :
 
 In the present scenario, the government declares a project and releases a tender for builders to express interest to work on. Then the builder who expresses the best interest favorable in terms of material quality and cost to the government finalizes the proposal. the government then releases funds that are in turn used by the builder to buy materials. This involves middlemen at multiple stages and an unaccounted commission. much of the funds go unaccounted. with the RFID and blockchain combined, we are trying to solve the problem by greater accountability.
 
 

The problems which we faced-

# The diffferent challenges we ran into included us figuring out cross platform integration due to lack of documentation.
